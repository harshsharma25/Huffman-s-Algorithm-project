Huffman’s Algorithm: A Comprehensive Report

1. Introduction to Huffman Algorithm

	Huffman’s Algorithm, developed by David A. Huffman in 1952, is a lossless data compression technique.		
	It efficiently encodes data by assigning shorter codes to more frequent symbols, resulting in optimal compression.


2. Basics of Binary Encoding

    Huffman coding represents data using binary codes (0s and 1s).
    Each symbol (character, pixel, etc.) is assigned a unique binary code.
    The goal is to minimize the average code length.


3. Need for Huffman Coding

    Traditional fixed-length encoding wastes space for infrequent symbols.
    Huffman coding adapts to the actual symbol frequencies, reducing redundancy.


4. Understanding Frequency Tables

    Construct a frequency table for input symbols.
    Sort symbols by frequency (ascending or descending).


5. Constructing the Huffman Tree

    Create a forest of singleton trees (each containing a symbol and its frequency).
    Repeatedly merge the two trees with the lowest frequencies into a new tree until only
    one tree remains—the Huffman tree.Assign 0 to left branches and 1 to right branches.


6. Assigning Huffman Codes

    Traverse the Huffman tree to assign unique binary codes to each symbol.
    Codes are prefix-free (no code is a prefix of another).


7. Advantages of Huffman Coding

    Optimal compression: Huffman codes minimize the average code length.
    Efficient decoding: No ambiguity in code interpretation.
    Widely used in file compression (e.g., ZIP files).


8. Real-World Applications

    Text compression: Reduces file sizes for storage and transmission.
    Image compression: JPEG and GIF formats use Huffman coding.
    Network protocols: Huffman coding optimizes data transmission.


9. Limitations of Huffman Coding

    Requires knowledge of symbol frequencies in advance.
    Sensitive to changes in input distribution (adaptive variants exist).


10. Conclusion

    Huffman’s Algorithm is a powerful tool for data compression. By intelligently assigning variable-length codes, 
    it achieves efficient storage and transmission. Understanding its principles and applications is essential in 
    the field of information theory.
